### Compiling and Running a Fortran Program

To compile a Fortran program into an executable using `gfortran`, which is part of the GCC, follow these steps:

1. **Compile the program**: `gfortran summation.f90 -o output`
This command compiles the `summation.f90` Fortran program into an executable named `output`.
2. **Run the program**: `./output`
After compilation, run the generated executable by typing `./output` in your terminal.

Remember to replace `summation.f90` with the name of your Fortran program file.
